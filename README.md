# Dart Learning - SOLID Principles

Dart Learning - SOLID Principles is a sample project from this lecture https://www.youtube.com/live/BcIcPVI3m28?si=TXkiPZQxgpTkAumN 
it's aimed at learning and implementing the SOLID principles using the Dart programming language. The project focuses on understanding and applying the SOLID principles to write clean, maintainable, and extensible code.

## What are SOLID Principles?

SOLID is an acronym that stands for:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
- **O**pen-Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

These principles help in achieving code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
